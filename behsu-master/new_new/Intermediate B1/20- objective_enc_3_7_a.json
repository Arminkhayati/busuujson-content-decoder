Last year’s 28.7m was the previous record, a three-fold rise since 2008, and a once unthinkable goal of 40m could be hit by 2020. In a country once largely overlooked on the global tourism trail, the figures are being trumpeted by the government. But Tokyo’s already crowded buses and trains are now even more congested. Businesses in Kyoto, the country’s ancient capital, moan they are being overrun by hordes of noisy gaijin. Such complaints—and fears of a popular backlash—have triggered a survey of local governments to discover ways tourists and residents can rub along. Yet there is no turning the tide. As the population falls and the economy shrinks, the one thing worse than kanko kogai, or “tourism pollution”, says one expert, is no tourism at all.</p>\n<i>© 2018 The Economist Newspaper Limited.

This week a French report went further than any before it in advocating that African treasures in museums should be returned to their countries of origin. The paper, by a French art historian and a Senegalese economist and writer, urges museums to return all objects that arrived from French colonies between the late 1800s and 1960 because they would have been removed without consent, if the country asks for them. France has 90,000 African objects, including 70,000 in the Musée du Quai Branly in Paris. The advice will cause ripples beyond France. More demands are expected, especially of the British Museum, the Victoria & Albert Museum and the Royal Museum for Central Africa in Tervuren, Belgium. The latter is due to reopen on December 9th after a five-year restructuring of the collection amassed during King Leopold II’s private rule over Congo between 1865 and 1908.</p>\n<i>© 2018 The Economist Newspaper Limited.

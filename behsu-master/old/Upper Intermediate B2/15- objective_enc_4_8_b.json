Mental-health problems are growing; they will affect one in two people at some point in their lives. Circulatory disease now accounts for one in three deaths and cancer one in four across the developed world. But in a bright spot, mortality rates have dropped rapidly in the European Union, by 40% for heart disease and 50% for strokes since 2000. But this takes money. Health-care spending, 10% of GDP on average, continues rising. And inequality, particularly in education, corresponds with a gulf in outcomes: a 30-year-old European man with only secondary-school education is eight percentage points more likely to be obese than his university-educated peer, and can expect to live seven years less. While correlation is not causation, it seems people learn and live rather than live and learn.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003E\u00a9 2018 The Economist Newspaper Limited. All rights reserved.

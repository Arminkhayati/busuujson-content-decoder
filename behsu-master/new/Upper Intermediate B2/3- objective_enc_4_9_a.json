The first case was recorded in Queensland, when an unfortunate shopper found a surprise inside his snack. Within days, copycats had contaminated punnets across the country, prompting supermarkets to pull strawberries (and sewing needles) from their shelves. Police received a total of 186 reports of spiked fruit, although a few turned out to be hoaxes. Today the first person to be charged for those crimes appeared at a court in Brisbane. Fifty year old My Ut Trinh was a supervisor at one of the affected farms and waged a pointed campaign “motivated by spite or revenge”, the Crown alleges. The offence would normally carry a three-year sentence, but the furore prompted the passage of a more punitive law on food tampering. If she is found guilty, Ms Trinh could spend a decade behind bars.</p>\n<i>© 2018 The Economist Newspaper Limited. All rights reserved. Published under licence.
